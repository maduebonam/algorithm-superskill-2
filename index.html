        //Implementation of Insertion Sort using JavaScript:

        //Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand.

        //Instructions

        //Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
        //Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.

        function insertionSort(arr) {
            for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
                // Store the current element in a variable
                let current = arr[i];

                // Initialize a variable j to track the index of the sorted sequence
                let j = i - 1;

                // Shift elements of the sorted sequence to the right to create a position for the current element
                while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > current) {
                    arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                    j--;
                }

                // Insert the current element into its correct position
                arr[j + 1] = current;
            }
        }

        // Example usage
        let array = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6];
        console.log("Original array:", array);
        insertionSort(array);
        console.log("Sorted array:", array);
